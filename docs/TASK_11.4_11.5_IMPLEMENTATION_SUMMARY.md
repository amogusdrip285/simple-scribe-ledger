## Adherence to Original Repository

The implementation closely follows the original @hyra-network/Scribe-Ledger repository:

1. **Architecture Compatibility**: Security features integrate seamlessly with existing distributed architecture
2. **Minimal Changes**: Security module is self-contained, no modifications to core storage or consensus
3. **Configuration Pattern**: Follows existing TOML configuration patterns
4. **Testing Pattern**: Security tests follow existing test structure and patterns
5. **Documentation Style**: Matches existing documentation style and format

## Performance Impact

### Optimizations Applied

1. **Token Bucket Rate Limiting**: O(1) token consumption and refill
2. **Per-Client Isolation**: HashMap-based client tracking
3. **Minimal Overhead**: Authentication only runs when enabled
4. **Efficient Logging**: Structured logging with compile-time filtering
5. **Atomic Operations**: Lock-free counters in rate limiter

### Benchmark Verification

- All benchmarks build successfully
- No changes to core storage or consensus paths
- Security checks are opt-in via configuration
- When disabled, zero performance impact

- ✅ Audit logging for compliance
- ✅ Certificate validation and rotation
- ✅ Secure defaults in configuration

### Operational Excellence
