# Simple Scribe Ledger - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

This document outlines the development roadmap for Simple Scribe Ledger, a distributed, immutable, append-only key-value storage system inspired by [Hyra Scribe Ledger](https://github.com/hyra-network/Scribe-Ledger). Our implementation uses **OpenRaft** for optimized consensus performance while maintaining the same architectural principles.

## ðŸš€ Vision

Simple Scribe Ledger provides a durable data layer for distributed applications. The system is designed for:

- **Durability:** Data, once committed, is considered permanent.
- **Immutability:** Data cannot be altered or deleted, only appended.
- **Verifiability:** Cryptographic proofs ensure data integrity.
- **Performance:** Optimized throughput with OpenRaft consensus.

### Key Implementation Differences
- **Consensus Library**: Using `openraft` (modern, async-first) instead of `raft-rs` for better performance
- **Optimized Architecture**: Focused on high-throughput distributed storage operations
- **Modern Rust Patterns**: Leveraging async/await patterns with Tokio for maximum efficiency

---

- **Testing**: Maintain >80% code coverage
- **Documentation**: Add doc comments for all public APIs
- **Error Handling**: Use `Result` types, avoid panics in production code

### Git Workflow
- Create feature branch for each task: `feature/task-X.Y-description`
- Write clear commit messages: `feat(consensus): implement raft state machine`
- Keep commits small and focused
- Run tests before pushing

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Test full system behavior
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical paths
- **Stress Tests**: Test system under load

### Performance Targets
- **Write Latency**: < 10ms local, < 50ms distributed
- **Read Latency**: < 1ms local, < 10ms distributed
- **Throughput**: > 10,000 ops/sec per node
- **Cluster Formation**: < 5 seconds for 3-node cluster
- **Leader Election**: < 2 seconds

---

## Success Criteria

Each phase is considered complete when:
1. All tasks in the phase are completed
2. All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)
3. Code passes `cargo clippy` with no warnings
4. Code is formatted with `cargo fmt`
5. Documentation is updated
6. Performance targets are met (if applicable)

---

## Getting Started

To begin development:

```bash
# Start with Phase 1, Task 1.1
git checkout -b feature/task-1.1-project-setup

# Complete the task following the checklist
# Run tests: cargo test
# Format: cargo fmt
# Lint: cargo clippy

# Commit and move to next task
git commit -am "feat(setup): complete project structure and dependencies"
git checkout -b feature/task-1.2-config-system
```

---

## Notes

- **OpenRaft vs raft-rs**: OpenRaft provides a more modern, async-first API compared to raft-rs
- **Task Granularity**: Each task should take 1-2 hours for an experienced developer, fitting within a single Copilot agent session
- **Dependencies**: Some tasks have dependencies on previous tasks - follow the order within phases
- **Flexibility**: Phases can be reordered if needed, but maintain task dependencies
- **Testing**: Always test incrementally - don't wait until the end of a phase
